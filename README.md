Speech-to-Text Converter:

This project is a simple, effective speech-to-text converter using Googleâ€™s SpeechRecognition library. It was created to solve a real-world problem me and my friend Rohan KS  faced when working on an academic presentation. Due to an unavoidable absence, we missed essential feedback from our mentor, and the recorded audio we received was heavily distorted by noise, making it hard to understand.

After trying various commercial tools, we realized that building our own speech-to-text tool was feasible and would be beneficial not only to us but also to other students facing similar challenges. With just a few lines of code, this project successfully extracts content from noisy audio files and converts it to text, enabling us to meet our deadlines effectively. This can even extract texts even if the audio having musics playing in the background.

Features:
Speech Recognition: Converts audio recordings to text for easy reference.
Noise Tolerance: Works reasonably well even with moderate background noise.
Easy to Use: Minimal code required for setup and operation.
